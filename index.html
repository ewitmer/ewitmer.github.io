  <h1>Hello, World</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my workspace for Hack Reactor Remote Prep. This is where I'll post my work for the day, and some musings as well.</p>
  <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>On day 1, we spent a lot of time getting our environment set up. We dove into a bit of coding, starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a>. </p>
    <p>Markdown is a markup language that is easy to read and write. We paired up and went through some of the exercises. Here is a bio of my partner, Sajal <a href="Day1/bio_sajal.md" target="_blank">written in Markup.</a> </p>
    <p>When it's converted to HTML (command + B in Sublime Text), it renders as a <a href="Day1/bio_sajal.html" target="_blank">web page</a>!</p> 
  <h3>The Challenge!</h3>
    <p>On to our first challenge: creating a fictional web page for a very specific Internet community. Have a look:</p><a href="Day1/index.html">Day 1 Challenge.</a>
